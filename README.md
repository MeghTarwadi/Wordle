# Wordle Game (Kisuke vs Aizen)

Welcome to **Wordle**‚Äîthe CLI (Command Line Interface) game that lets you have a showdown with the legendary Aizen (from Bleach)! üéÆ Whether you want to guess the word or let the computer guess for you, this game has got you covered with a quirky twist of fun.

## Overview

This project is a **Wordle** game, where you play against Aizen (the computer) or guess words yourself. There are two modes:
1. **Guessing Mode**: You try to guess a randomly chosen word.
2. **Aizen Mode**: The computer (Aizen) tries to guess the word you picked.

In **Aizen Mode**, the algorithm gives you reasons why it chose certain words, and it does so in a fun dialogue format between **Kisuke Urahara (you)** and **Sosuke Aizen**. The output is like reading a story or a manga where you and Aizen are in a battle of wits!

## Features

- **A fun CLI game** where you face off with the famous Bleach characters.
- **Customizable word dataset**: Change `words_original.txt` to modify the words you play with.
- **Algorithm Explanation**: Each time Aizen guesses, you'll get a reason behind the guess. It‚Äôs like having your personal strategy coach!
- **Simplicity**: Only **two libraries** (stdlib.h and stdio.h) used, the rest is all custom-made code to make the game run fast and smooth.

## How to Play

1. **Download and Run**: Simply download the code from Git and run the `.c` file in your terminal. 
   - Example command (after downloading): 
     ```bash
     cd /wordle
     ./wordle
     ```

2. **Modes**: 
   - Guess the word: You try to guess the word, and the game will tell you which characters are in the right position and which ones aren‚Äôt.
   - Let Aizen guess: Choose a word, and let Aizen (the computer) guess it by following a unique algorithm that explains every step!

3. **Dialogue with Aizen**: During the game, Aizen will explain why it picked each word, and you‚Äôll interact with him like reading a conversation in a manga.

4. **Custom Dataset**: Want to make it your own? Just modify `words_original.txt` with words of your choice. The program will split words based on length, and you‚Äôll be ready to play your own customized version!

## How the Algorithm Works

The game uses a **linked list** to store potential word guesses and employs an algorithm I created to guess the word in just 2‚Äì3 guesses for large words. For smaller words (5-8 letters), it may take **4-5 guesses**. 

The magic happens like this:
- **Fixed positions**: Words that have characters in the right position are kept in the list.
- **Characters present but in wrong position**: We remove all words that place these characters in the wrong position.
- **No matching characters**: We eliminate words that don‚Äôt contain the guessed characters.

This repeats until the computer guesses the correct word! And along the way, Aizen explains **why** each guess was made.

## Installation

Not much installation required here. Just download the code and **run** it! 

Here‚Äôs how it works:
1. Download the `.c` file.
2. Run the executable and enjoy!

---

## Known Issues

- **Core Dumps**: If you input a super long word, the program might throw a **core dump** error and die (don't worry, it's not your fault, it's just the program trying its best to not crash under extreme conditions!).

## Why Did I Make This?

Honestly, I was inspired by a **YouTube video** that used AI to solve Wordle, and I thought, ‚ÄúCan I make something like that?‚Äù After some tinkering, I came up with this idea and turned it into a fun project. So, yeah, no one's probably going to use it, but I think it's fun to share and let others peek into how I think about algorithms.

## Future Improvements

There are **no future improvements** planned for now. This project is more about **fun** and **learning**. If you have suggestions or want to add something, feel free to fork it and make it your own!

Enjoy guessing with Aizen and Kisuke! And remember, it‚Äôs all just for fun. üòé
